This directory contains annotated schemas used to merge NERDm
documents.  Specifically, it contains schemas for the **midas0** merge
conventions, used to merge PDR annotations (representing author
customizations) into base metadata generated from MIDAS (via the POD
record) according to the initial (labeled "0") policy governing metadata
updates.  This policy requires that all core metadata--metadata
covered by the POD record--must be edited via MIDAS and must go
through review.  Extended metadata supported by NERDm can be pulled in
from annotations generated by the user via the PDR publishing view.
This merge convention enforces this policy.

Because of limitations of jsonmerge (including its lack of awareness
of ejsonschema conventions), the core NERDm schema is represented by
`nerdm-amalgamated-schema.json` which folds different resource and 
and component types together.
