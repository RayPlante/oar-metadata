<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

The NERDm schema is used to encode metadata describing various kinds
of <em>resources</em>--datasets, data collections, web portals,
software, and tools--that are offered by NIST through its
<a href="https://data.nist.gov/">data science portal</a>.  Resources
are the main kind of "thing" that NERDm metadata is used to describe,
and there are different types resources.  NERDm metadata is encoded in
JSON format (specifically, <a href="https://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a>),
but this guide attempts to describe the metadata without relying on
much knowledge of that format.  The purpose of this document is to
guide readers that wish to inspect NERDm JSON records and understand
that the metadata means.  
</p>

<p>
(Software developers that wish to read and process NERDm records may
also find this document useful for browsing metadata definitions.
However, they can also consult the
<a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> definition
documents useful.  The NERDm schema has two parts: a
<a href="https://data.nist.gov/od/dm/nerdm-schema/">core schema</a>,
and an <a href="https://data.nist.gov/od/dm/nerdm-pub-schema/">an
extension schema for describing data publications</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Below is an annotated example of a NERDm record describing a data
resource.  The metadata is in the form of a set of <em>properties</em>.  A
<a href="#def:property" title="definition: property">property</a> is a
piece of metadata that has a <em>name</em> and a <em>value</em>.  The
<a href="def:value_type" title="definition: value type">value</a> can
be a single value (e.g. text, a number, true/false), a list of values,
or a complex values made up of sub-properties.
